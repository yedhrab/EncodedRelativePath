## ❗ Important

### 📂 In Multi root workspaces:

Everytime you switch to a file from a different folder the files in that folder are indexed and
cached to improve search performance. If you have multiple large folders part of a workspace
frequent switches between folders might slow you down.

### 📁 In Single project workspace:

The caching of the filelist in the project happens only once. If your workspace contains a lot of files
please wait for the initial file list to be created.

## ⛏ Options

The following Visual Studio Code settings are available for the RelativePath extension. They can be set in user preferences (`ctrl+,` or `cmd+,`) or workspace settings (.vscode/settings.json).

```javascript

	// An array of glob keys to ignore when searching.
	"encodedRelativePath.ignore": [
		"**/node_modules/**",
		"**/*.dll",
		"**/obj/**",
		"**/objd/**"
	],

	// A glob by which to filter results
	"encodedRelativePath.include": "/**/*.*"

	// Excludes the extension from the relative path url (Useful for systemjs imports).
	"encodedRelativePath.removeExtension": false,

	// An array of extensions to exclude from the relative path url (Useful for used with Webpack or when importing files of mixed types)
	"encodedRelativePath.excludedExtensions": [
		".js"
	],

```

> For more options type `encodedRelativePath.` in `settings.json`.
